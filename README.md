# Pulstream Documentation

## Welcome to Pulstream 🚀

**Pulstream** is a high-performance stream processing platform built for real-time Solana data analysis and signal generation. It enables developers to create, deploy, and monetize custom data processing streams using WASM functions that react to blockchain events in real-time.

## ✨ Key Features

- **⚡ Real-time Solana Data Processing**: Direct integration with Solana blockchain via Yellowstone gRPC geyser plugin
- **🔧 WASM-based Functions**: Write logic in Rust, compile to WASM for sandboxed execution
- **📡 Low Latency Signal Generation**: Sub-second detection and propagation of trading opportunities
- **📱 Automated Social Alerts**: Push notifications to Discord, Telegram, Twitter and other platforms
- **🤖 Automated Trading Execution**: Direct integration with DEXs and trading protocols
- **💰 Stream Monetization**: Revenue sharing model for stream creators

## 🎯 Use Cases
- **Trading Signal Generation**: Custom indicators and trading signals based on on-chain data
- **Arbitrage Detection**: Identify price discrepancies across DEXs in real-time
- **DeFi Analytics**: Track liquidity, yields, and protocol metrics
- **Portfolio Tracking**: Monitor wallet activities and performance
- **Risk Management**: Build alerts for position monitoring and risk metrics
- **Whale Tracking**: Detect large transactions and wallet movements

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

Pulstream consists of four main components:

* **Carbon Router** - Ingests real-time Solana blockchain data
* **Runtime Engine** - Executes user functions in WASM environment  
* **Function Server** - Manages function deployment via REST API
* **Signal Distribution** - Delivers signals to consumers
